- Analytics


## Design Decisions

### Authentication Strategy
- JWT-based authentication for secure, stateless user sessions
- Role-based access control for three distinct user types

### Database Design
- Normalized relational database schema to maintain data integrity
- Efficient indexing for common queries like restaurant searches and reservation lookups

### User Experience
- Mobile-responsive design to accommodate users on various devices
- Intuitive reservation flow minimizing steps to complete a booking
- Real-time availability updates to prevent double bookings

### Security Considerations
- Password hashing and secure credential storage
- Data validation on both client and server sides
